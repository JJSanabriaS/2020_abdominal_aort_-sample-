# Computational Modeling of Cardiac Fluid Dynamics MATLAB & R

## 1. Introduction

The human heart is a complex biomechanical pump that:

    * Circulates blood throughout the body
    * Maintains pressure gradients
    * Responds dynamically to physiological changes

Understanding cardiac fluid dynamics is essential for:

    * Cardiovascular disease diagnosis
    * Surgical planning
    * Device design (valves, stents)
    * Hemodynamic research

## 2. Objective of the Study

    * Develop a simplified mathematical model of heart blood flow
    * Simulate pressure-volume dynamics
    * Analyze flow behavior computationally
    * Implement and visualize results using:
        * MATLAB
        * R
    * Generates svientific article for best ranked magazines
